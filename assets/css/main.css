/* we @import .scss instead of .sass due to .scss having the easier syntax to @import
   this file is @importd to include various sass files
   the purpose of having these sass partials is for modular design.

   If you plan to add a partial file be sure to include an underscore
   and add @import "partials/directoryName/_yourFileName.scss"; to this
   main.scss file.

   Also if you are using browsersync, make sure your changes are applied.
   You may need to restart browsersync
