/* we use .scss instead of .sass due to .scss having the easier syntax to use
   this file is used to include various sass files
   the purpose of having these sass partials is for modular design

   If you plan to add a partial file be sure to include an underscore
   and add @import "partials/directoryName/_yourFileName.scss"; to this file.
   Also if you are using browsersync, make sure your changes are applied.
   You may need to restart browsersync
