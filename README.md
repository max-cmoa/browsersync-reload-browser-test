# reload-browser-test
  When you want to see the changes in index.html, just open or reload the index.html file. One can still run the $ gulp command from the root. Basically due to node, the file index.js will be found and the tasks within it will be ran

## How to run
    $ cd projectDirectory
    $ gulp
    
Browsersync will open a localhost. Please see the text on index.html, styles.css, and test.js. I hope you grasp a better understanding of using browsersync with gulp.
