# browsersync-reload-browser-test
  Example that shows how browsersync works when $ gulp is ran.
  When you want to see the changes in index.html, just open or reload the index.html file.

## How to run
    $ cd browsersync-reload-browser-test
    or
    $ cd browsersync-reload-browser-test-master
    $ gulp

Browsersync will start a server and open a localhost on port 3000. Please see the text on index.html, styles.css, and test.js. I hope you grasp a better understanding of using browsersync with gulp and how the project is structured. You may have noticed that we use features from gulp 3 when the current version is gulp 4. It is okay to use gulp 3. One day we may migrate to gulp 4, but why fix what isn't broken and poses no security issues.
