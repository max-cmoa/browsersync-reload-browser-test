# browsersync-reload-browser-test
  Example that shows how browsersync works when $ gulp is ran.
  When you want to see the changes in index.html, just open or reload the index.html file.

## How to run
    $ cd projectDirectory
    $ gulp

Browsersync will open a localhost. Please see the text on index.html, styles.css, and test.js. I hope you grasp a better understanding of using browsersync with gulp.
